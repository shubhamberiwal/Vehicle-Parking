# Vehicle-Parking
Simple implementation of the Vehicle Parking
This is a demonstration of how object oriented programming
or oop can be used in real life.

One can just clone the project and run the main
CarParking.java file in its console and see the
functionality for himself.
Info: CarParking.java file is inside src/packagepark.

This Project includes almost all of these topics:
  Abstraction- Classes.
  Scope and Lifetime of variables.
  Declaring objects.
  Instance Variables of different data types.
  Constructors/Methods.
  'this' keyword.
  Inheritance.
  Overloading (Constructors/Methods)
  Overriding.
  Objects as parameters.
  Access control mechanism.
  Use of 'super'.
  Packages.
  Interfaces.
  Exception Handling.
  Creation of thread to execute a certain process.
  
  This is a part of my college oopj project.


  Also the output screenshots is shown in the output demo
  folder. Do check that out for reference.
  
  Thank You for reading this. Have a good day!!
